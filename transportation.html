            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            <p>
              Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on
              a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night
              per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate
              small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of
              expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
              island within the next few years.
            </p>

            <h2>Ground Transportation</h2>
            <p>
              Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.
              every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are
              available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a
              local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are
              available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by
              law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists
              stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy
              to explore on foot.
