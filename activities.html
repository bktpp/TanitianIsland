            <h2>Entertainment</h2>
            <p>
              Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the
              rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, there are other
              things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on
              chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest,
              visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new
              dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an
              arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole
              golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these
              activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly
              developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.

            <h2>Sightseeing</h2>
            <p>
              Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which
              boasts native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that
              encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. Other popular activities include boat or
              bus tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to
              Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.
